She?s rehearsing for a ballroom dance competition, juggling two jobs, and dealing with an ex-boyfriend who can?t take the hint it?s over. Yet despite all that, she still has plenty of time and energy to tell Shane Lindley to screw off.Shane just moved into her apartment building and seems dedicated to sleeping his way through her entire cheerleading squad. Sure, he?s a tall, gorgeous hockey player, but he?s messing with her turf. This calls for some ground rules: no parties in her apartment, leave her teammates alone, and?most importantly?leave her alone.What Diana doesn?t realize is that Shane?s sick of hookups and tired of being on the rebound after his long-term girlfriend called it quits. He wants a relationship. And when his ex comes back into the picture, he pretends he has one to make her jealous?and who better to play the girlfriend role than his sassy new neighbor?Despite Diana?s reluctance to break her rule, a fake relationship is </p>
